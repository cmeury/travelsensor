- Main code is licensed under Apache Version 2, see LICENSE file.
- The timer code comes from the [Metro library](https://github.com/thomasfredericks/Metro-Arduino-Wiring) but was rewritten and modified to use arrays in Sketch. That paticular code (timer_reset, timer_check) is licensed differently than the main travelsensor.ino (see TIMER-LICENSE file).
